Migration
=========
If you are migrating from 1.x.x version of our SDK, there are several breaking changes that you will need to take into consideration. A considerable part of the API in version 1 was removed and replaced with a simplified new API that unifies integration of remote notifications, location services, user authentication, contextual content and analytics in iOS 8 up to iOS 11.
